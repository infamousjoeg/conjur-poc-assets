## üìç Overview

The project consists of scripts and configuration files for integrating with Conjur, a secrets management system, and setting up permissions and access control for managing secrets in AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault. It provides a secure way to fetch and manage secret credentials during Jenkins CI/CD pipeline deployments, Terraform infrastructure provisioning, and Azure and AWS configuration management. This streamlines the management of sensitive information in a centralized and secure manner, enhancing security and best practices for secret management in a multi-cloud environment.

| [RegisterSecretsHub_EntraID.ps1](https://github.com/infamousjoeg/conjur-poc-assets/blob/main/secretshub/azure/arm/RegisterSecretsHub_EntraID.ps1) | This code manages the creation of an Azure app registration, service principal, and access permissions to a Key Vault. It checks for resource group and Key Vault existence, creates a new app registration and service principal, and assigns access permissions to the Key Vault using either RBAC or access policies. Finally, it retrieves and displays the app client credentials. |

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
